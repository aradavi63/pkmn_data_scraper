Repo contains files I used to scrape data for my other project

It has a lot of admittedly really bad practices, I did data related to Mega Evolutions and GMaxes separately because I was lazy to code it in
Some of the sprite names I had to redo manually because the way Bulbapedia handles multiple forme types of the same Pokemon is a pain
